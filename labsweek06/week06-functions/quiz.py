# function yo takes one parameter
def yo(a):
    return a * 2
# here we are calling the function yo
# and are passing in an argument, 3
print (yo(3))

# Question 1. Nothing will be printed because you have not called on anything to be printed. you need to add the print 
# function to run the program and run the argument

# Question 2 add print before yo(3) to get the function to work print (yo(3))
